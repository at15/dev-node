# dev-node

Setup all the Hxx in one directory, this repo contains scripts and full example configs that should work on both Ubuntu and Mac OS X

## Softwares

Besides the Hxx, it also have some other software I use very often

- [ ] Hadoop 2.7.1
- [ ] HBase 1.2.1
- [ ] Hive ?
- [ ] Cassandra ?
- [ ] KairosDB ?

## Scripts

- [ ] extract tarball to `app` folder
- [ ] copy config 
- [ ] check common errors when setup hadoop, like forgot to format namenode 

## Why?

- I want to share hadoop and all the hxx instead of bundle one in every project like https://github.com/at15/forum-search
- the config for all the hxx is annoying
- docker is hard to use due to network issue
