# dev-node

Setup all the Hxx in one directory, this repo contains scripts and full example configs that should work on both Ubuntu and Mac OS X

## Softwares

Besides the Hxx, it also have some other software I use very often

- [x] [Hadoop 2.7.1](script/hadoop)
- [ ] HBase 1.2.1
- [x] Hive 1.2.1
- [ ] Cassandra ?
- [ ] KairosDB ?

## Scripts

- [x] download tarball from mirror.
- [x] extract tarball to `app` folder
- [x] copy config 
- [ ] check common errors when setup hadoop, like forgot to format namenode 

## Why?

- I want to share hadoop and all the hxx instead of bundle one in every project like https://github.com/at15/forum-search
- the config for all the hxx is annoying, the doc always forget to mention sth or hide it in somewhere
- docker is hard to use due to network issue
